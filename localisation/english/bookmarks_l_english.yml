 UKM_AGE_OF_UNCERTAINTY_DESC:0 "For nearly eight and a half centuries, the Butterfly Kingdom was one of Mewni's premiere powers, with the kingdom taking an active role in settling disputes throughout the continent. This makes it that much more shocking to see how far the kingdom has fallen in just under three years. The War of the Worlds brought the kingdom into a deep political and economic crisis, with the young Queen Star Butterfly being at the head of it all. Despite Queen Star's unpopularity with the public, she is determined to accomplish the herculian task of regaining the kingdom's former status, although failure will entail unforseen consquences for both her, and her people."
