With mewmans dissatisfied with Queen Eclipsa’s reforms and the carnage wrought by the War of the World’s, and monsters in turn dissatisfied with the still rampant prejudice against them, it seems as if the number of supporters for reconciliation dwindles with each passing day.

 butterfly.1.d:0 "As the winter sunlight entered the Queen’s room and cast itself onto her majesty’s eyes, Star Butterfly awoke to another day. Had it been a few years earlier, she would have enveloped herself deeper into the blankets to shield her from the cold for a few more hours, eventually coming down to the kitchen around nine to start her day, but now she had more pressing needs in front of her. The seemingly carefree days of her early adolescence seemed so long ago, with her days now consisting of seemingly endless meetings with Mewnisters and bureaucrats bearing constant bad news about every aspect of state. It had taken a toll on her, and although the stress now was nowhere near what it had been during the war or its immediate aftermath, to say she felt relaxed was a severe understatement.\n\nEntering the bathroom, she began preparing herself for the day ahead, washing and getting changed into moderate regalia to make herself presentable. It was a tedious process, and though she had maids to bear the brunt of the work, she preferred to do it herself, the same with cooking and cleaning her chambers as she hoped it would build discipline, something she hoped her mother would have been proud of. As she finished fastening the buttons on her dress, she tried to cheer herself up by remembering Marco's upcoming graduation in a few months time, giving him a little more time to spend with her in person, and although he would have to head back to Earth for college, the few times he could visit in person were always the highlights of her year. He was one of the few people she could trust completely now, with the knives against her growing sharper by the day, both outside and inside her court.\n\nShe was not a popular ruler, far from it, and with how things were going, she might be remembered as one of Mewni’s worst, yet she did not let it deter her from her role as Queen. She still held an obligation towards her people and her family, and she was determined to maintain her reign solely to do them both better for as long as she was able. Stirring herself one final time, she opened the door and left for another day."

 butterfly.2.d:0 "“I really did think that the War would’ve been the catalyst for her to sit down and shut up, but she’s still as abrasive, erratic, and forceful as she’s ever been!”\n\n“It’s probably because of her Johansson side; you know how stubborn and uncontrollable they can be, really it explains a lot about her,” Felicity Butterfly took a bite out of one of the muffins provided to her as she awaited Lady Jasmine’s response. “Most certainly, we should have realized our mistake when she prevented our rollback of Queen Eclipsa’s “reforms” and solidified them into law. That was telling enough that she wouldn’t make our recovery easy.”\n\nAnd that was what Felicity had been looking for. She’d known that some of the Mewnisters had become unsatisfied with Queen Star’s actions through the usual court gossip, and she had bet that the rumors surrounding Jasmine Flowers had been one of the more reliable ones. “Well, I hope that the Mewnisters will get their way with her eventually,” she paused for a moment, still preparing herself for the crucial proposition. “After all, they do have the power to remove her should they deem it necessary.”\n\nLady Jasmine paused for a moment, in slight shock over what she’d just heard, knowing very well what this meant for Felicity, given her position as Crown Princess. “I… I agree that it would be nice not to have Star on the throne, but we are going into uncharted territory here. The institutions to facilitate the process have existed for the past two and a half centuries, but we’ve never used them before, never had to use them before.” “True, true, but the fact that such institutions exist, to begin with, would give us enough legitimacy to pull it off. And why would they exist if they were intended never to be used? Weren’t they made explicitly so that we could save the Kingdom from itself? I would be lying if I said that I was completely confident in our abilities, but I do believe that it’s what’s best for all of us.”There was a few seconds of silence between the two nobles as Jasmine contemplated her response, but finally, she spoke. “I don’t know what to say, it’s extremely risky to attempt this, and both of us could be in serious jeopardy if we fail, but it might be even riskier to let Star rule unabated. I can’t say that I’ll be able to support you actively, but if push does come to shove, I will be on the side that wishes for her ousting. I’m sorry, but I hope you understand.”\n\n“There’s no need to apologize Jasmine; that’s all I wanted anyway.”"

 butterfly.3.d:0 "The streets of the Butterfly Castle Castletown were still quite lively that night but of little concern to Terrence Farbrook; if anything, they would make him more discreet. Entering a nearby inn, he approached the innkeeper before whispering to him, “I’m here for the gambling.” On cue, the innkeeper pulled a ring of keys from behind his desk and motioned for him to follow. Taking Farbrook up to the second floor through the stairwell at the leftmost point of the building, and then down a hallway to his right to the far end, he unlocked a door that opened into a meeting room, with a polished wooden circular table at the center with four other figures gathered around it.\n\n“I’m sorry for being a little late, everyone,” the innkeeper closed the door behind him as he continued, “My wife had a bit of an emergency, but the doctors are saying she’s stable for the time being, and she shouldn’t have another episode for a while.”\n\n“You know you could’ve just skipped the meeting at that point considering the circumstances, and no one would have been upset. I can’t say the same for your wife, but that’s beside the point,” a brief chuckle was heard around the room as Lawrence finished his remarks.\n\nAmong the room were five of the most prominent republicans within the United Kingdoms, assuming the mantle of the United Republican Front. All of them had differing backgrounds and experiences, but all were united in their goal of bringing down the monarchy. Robert Lawrence, a lawyer and former prosecutor for Queen Moon, Herschel Newman, a former Marshal of the Butterfly Army, and practicing lawyer, Julia Cast, a journalist and editor-in-chief for the Commoner’s Post, Terrence Farbrook, an accountant for the Crown, and Pattie Verdin, a university professor.\n\n“Now, to get back on track,” Cast took the floor and reigned the group back in. “Marshal Newman, I believe you have some news regarding militia recruitment?”\n\n“Certainly. Recruitment has been high by our standards for the last six months, although I believe we will soon hit our limit on how many we can field without running our reserves thin, both in manpower and equipment. I estimate that number will be somewhere between thirty to thirty-five thousand, possibly even more so if we consider our sister organizations across the country. The floor is doused; we just need to wait for it to ignite.”"

The Corn Regulators have also done well in keeping the price of corn depressed while buying high from farmers, it still operates at a loss, but that’s to be expected.”\n\n“That’s good, uh, anyone else?”\n\nPercy McKnight took the initiative, “The rollout of firearms and artillery has been going relatively smoothly to the remainder of the standing army following its success in the Royal Guard, although I can’t give an estimate on completion, though.” Falcon Redbird followed, “I can say the same with regards to our security services, although completion won’t be expected until the end of the year if everything goes to plan.”\n\n“Anything else? Anyone? Alright, let’s hear the bad news.”\n\nAlmost immediately, Lady Jasmine Flowers spoke up, “Your highness, crime across the entirety of the United Kingdoms has been at an all-time high for nearly two years. Reports of banditry are rampant among highway goers, drug and alcohol-related deaths have reached all-time highs, domestic violence has been on the rise with the decrease in the quality of life, and this doesn’t even mention the riots that engulf cities every few months. As your Mewnister of Justice, I implore you to increase investment in the city guards and highway patrols around the country to-”\n\n“Do you think that we can afford such an expansion?!” Lady Ruby Stone interjected. “The last thing we need is more spending considering how tight the budget already is.”\n\n“Calm down Ruby, Jasmine’s expressing some good points here,” the Queen silenced Lady Stone before she continued. “I’m sure we can just move some money around to give the Justice Mewnistry more of the budget. I think you could work that out, right?”\n\n“It’s possible, yes, but that money is going to have to come out of somewhere.”\n\n“I know, and I trust that you’ll make the cuts that will cause the least harm; it’s the best for everyone,” Queen Star responded."

We all went to the beach today with the warm weather coming in and had a lot of fun playing in the ocean. So much so I believe everyone except me has passed out already. Should probably get Raphael off the couch now that I think about it.” This was good news to Star, as she gave a light smile as she heard Angie dotting about the two children, although she knew that she had to get to the meat of the conversation soon.\n\n“That’s great to hear, but aside from that, there’s something else I wanted to ask you.”\n\n“Hm? And what would that be?” Star braced for the subject as Angie appeared perplexed and curious before breaking the brief pause, saying, “Listen, you’ve had Meteora for about a year and a half now, and I think it’s time to talk about what exactly our plans are for her moving forward. With how things are developing on Mewni, I don’t think I’ll be able to give Meteora a comfortable life here in the castle, given the public’s general disdain for her and Eclipsa, not to mention how most people believe she’s dead.” She paused again, still bracing for the final delivery. “I think that it might be best for Meteora to stay on Earth, permanently.”\n\nThere was an air of silence around the room as Angie let the information sink in. Finally, she broke it “Star, Raphael and I would be more than happy to take care of Meteora for you, but you do how risky that is given Meteora’s situation.”\n\n“I know, but it’s the best solution I can think of. I know that Earth is pretty tolerant when it comes to disorders, so I think we can get away with calling Meteora a human, even as she gets older, but it’s still going to require us to hide some of the more unforgiving features, especially with the anti-Mewman sentiment that’s going around after the war.”\n\n“Star, I understand where you’re coming from here, but how do you know you aren’t making the same mistake St Olga and Shastican made when they brought up Meteora?”\n\n“Look, the least we can do is be honest with her, we won’t hide anything about her situation or her past from her, and we’ll be there for her when things may get a little rough for her. I can’t say it will be easy, but it is the best I can do under the circumstances. I made a promise to Eclipsa before she died, and that was to take care of Meteora, and I’m determined to keep it.”"

 butterfly.6.t:0 "Reinvigorating the Private Sector"
 butterfly.6.d:0 "While most of the physical damage from the war has been repaired, viewing the success of reconstruction from such a perspective would be misleading. This is because the public works projects used to facilitate these repairs only represent temporary jobs the average mewman can make a living off of before a more permanent solution can be found. Although restoring our cities and infrastructure represent a critical aspect of reconstruction in rebuilding our nation's internal coordination and supply lines, this alone will not be enough to lift us out of the deep depression we find ourselves in.\n\nTo ensure the continuation of our economic recovery, Queen Star, alongside Mewnister of the Treasury Ruby Stone, today unveiled the creation of the Economic Recovery Fund to assist various businesses in getting back on their feet after the collapse from the war, accomplishing this by giving out government grants to business owners who will hopefully begin selling their goods anew.\n\nAlthough the approach is a novel one for Mewni, it has come under criticism from some economists for its assumption that commoners will resume spending at pre-war levels, leaving the stimulus as only a stopgap measure before the businesses once again go bankrupt. Additional criticism has also been levied in how the government may not be able to afford the program's expenditures with the harsh reparations imposed by the Americans. However, the Queen has reassured the public that the budgetary effects of the program would be negligible due to funding being derived through increased vassal taxes on the various noble houses.\n\nIn truth, like much of fiscal policy, the nation won't know the program's full impact until it's in effect for a significant period of time, leaving us to simply wait and see how it develops."

 butterfly.8.t:0 "The Status of Mewman-Monster Relations"
 butterfly.8.d:0 "With the very foundation of the Butterfly Kingdom being based on the conquest and expulsion of the native monster races and tribes during Mewnipendence, the relationship between the two peoples has naturally been one of mutual conflict and distrust incursions into both side’s territories being commonplace in the following centuries. For all intents and purposes, this status quo should’ve been upheld for the foreseeable future, yet the series of events that have transpired over the past four and a half years have dramatically changed the government’s outlook on the topic.\n\nQueen Star’s time on Earth gave her a newfound empathy and appreciation for monsterdom, contrary to the feelings of the majority of the population, and has since worked to improve the status of cross-species relations, albeit to mixed results. The controversial second reign of Queen Eclipsa coupled with the War of the Worlds has not helped in this matter, with much of the population having their view of monsterdom worsen, which consequently has turned many monsters away from the possibility of reconciliation due to a lack of confidence in the mewman’s ability to enact meaningful change. This has caused the support base for reconciliation to dwindle even further from its admittedly small starting position a few years ago, with it only being kept alive through the Queen’s maintenance of key allies due to her personal relationship with them.\n\nThe allies in particular refer to the polities of House Avarius and Monsterville within the Forest of Certain Death, whose leaders have both pledged their pro-Butterfly stance, regardless of their detractors within certain tribal and communal leaders, who support a more nationalistic policy in line with the Kingdom of Septarsis. Regardless, reconciliation is still in a precarious position politically, and any major blunder could result in the complete collapse of relations to a level not seen since the Dark Ages.\n\nWith this in mind, Queen Star has elected to hold Monstercon 45 to help improve mewman-monster relations. Held at the Forest Watchtower and being the second in the line of Monstercon conventions, Monstercon 45 hopes to be bigger and better than its predecessor, hosting leaders and representatives of the various monster tribes to encourage a cross-cultural exchange among the two peoples. Although we can’t hope for this to completely resolve the issue, we can hope to use the event to serve as a building block for future, more encompassing policies."
 butterfly.8.a:0 "Let’s hope for a smooth event"
 butterfly.9.t:0 "Replies"
 butterfly.9.d:0 "Six letters rested on Queen Star’s desk as she laid back in her chair, contemplating the responses from the various monster tribes. The Dogmen, Frogmen, Slime, and Kappa Tribes had all agreed to attend Monstercon 45, with Serpentina’s government for Septarsis also agreeing to represent the Septerian Tribe. This wasn’t concerning, of course; as the close, if tenuous alliances with the tribes had all but assured their attendance, it was the other tribes that had her worried. The sixth letter contained a response from the Mud Dweller Tribe bordering the United Kingdoms in the east, in which they declined to attend the convention, while also insulting the United Kingdoms and Star personally, calling her things such as “a moronic monster moth incapable of forming a rational thought,” among other colorful language.\n\nAlthough she knew she should have expected such a response given the mud dweller’s history of defiance against the Butterfly Kingdom, it still hurt her on a deeper level. She had always been trying her hardest to bring mewmans and monsters together, but it always seemed her plans to achieve it would constantly be stonewalled by a society that refused to change. Her hopes and dreams never went past her close circle of allies, and even they seemed to be disappearing. Eclipsa was dead, her mother was dead, the monster’s hope for reconciliation was growing duller and more radical by the day, and her attempts at making inroads towards the pro-Septarian tribes have felt like slamming her head against a brick wall.\n\nJust then, a maid knocked on the door.\n\n“Your highness, you have a letter from the Bearnicorn Tribe.”\n\n“Great, another rejection letter to read,” she thought to herself as she opened the door to retrieve the document, thanking the maid before closing the door and returning to her desk, opening the letter to find a brief message written on it.\n\n“To Queen Star Butterfly of the United Kingdoms of Southern Mewni\nThe Bearnicorn Tribe will be willing to send a delegation to your Monstercon 45 event. My son Beau will lead the delegation to represent our culture. It should be made perfectly and unobtrusively clear that ANY harm that comes upon the delegation will result in a resumption of hostilities between our two peoples.\n-Sincerely, Queen Ursa of the Bearnicorn Tribe”\n\nIt wasn’t any flattering praise or enthusiastic hope, but it was enough to make Star smile just before heading back to her chambers."

What better way to help bring Mewmans and Monsters together than to have one of the biggest people against Monsters come out in support of them at Monstercon?” Star reiterated her plan to Juniper, still unconvinced of the prospect. “Well, for one, considering the current reputation of the royal family, such a drastic turnaround would guarantee conspiracies about foul play, rightfully albeit, but still a detriment to the government’s legitimacy. Then there’s the fact that such speculation will embolden Mina’s supporters and give even more credence to their claims of a monster takeover of the government, and to top it all off, most monsters probably won’t even appreciate the endorsement considering she’s already tried to get them all killed! All this appearance will do is further divide the people we are supposedly trying to unify, and with each misstep, blunder, and controversy, that task becomes more and more of an uphill climb. We aren’t doing it. We can’t do it.”\n\n“Are you sure you aren’t being a little too overdramatic about this? I mean, Mina’s endorsement could just as well weaken the Sun Shirt’s as opposed to strengthening it,” Star retorted.\n\n“Well, that’s not a risk I’m willing to take. As House Forest is hosting both the convention and Mina Loveberry, I am forbidding her attendance at the event in any fashion whatsoever.”"

 butterfly.11.t:0 "The Opening of Monstercon 45"
 butterfly.11.d:0 "“Just stick to the script, and everything should sort itself out,” Star muttered to herself as she stepped onto the stage. Public speaking was never her strong suit, but she was obligated to do so as Queen, only hoping that her self-written speeches conveyed a decent sense of honesty and humility to the people. Even then, it wasn’t like she could be substituted anyway, she was one of the only pro-reconciliation members of her government, and their tolerance for her repeated missteps and blunders waned more and more with each passing day. She couldn’t deal with a return to the status quo, and though she staved off disaster with the War, tensions still boiling beneath the surface, and she could only hope Monstercon would help cool them. Arriving at the podium, she began to address the assembled crowd of mewmans and monsters, as well as the presumably hundreds of thousands watching from home.\n\n“Good morning everyone, I hope everyone is having a good day so far because it’s about to get a whole lot better!” A slight pause was marked by silence from the crowd. “Uh, since the last Monstercon a year ago, I think we’ve made some really good progress in terms of bringing everybody together, and I sincerely hope that this one can do the same through the exposure and exchange of culture between mewmans and monsters. Of course, even though progress has been made, that doesn’t mean that we’re done, because unfortunately, there remains a significant portion of our society that refuses to see monsters as anything but hordes of barbarians instead of the intricate and complex collection of tribes that they are. While it’s also true that many monsters like the Septarians hold similar feelings, it doesn’t excuse this kind of behavior since no species can be categorized so strictly, with the vast majority simply wanting peace and a good life for themselves and their families.”\n\nAnother brief pause, this time to see how the people were responding. Many of the mewmans were giving mixed gestures to the Queen, while the monsters generally appeared supportive of her as usual, though that was to be expected considering their more liberal tendencies. Still, there weren’t any hecklers, so it wasn’t too bad. “With that settled, I would like to extend my gratitude to House Forest for hosting the convention again, the monster tribes who decided to attend, and finally to all the regular attendees who want to have fun or just want to know what’s going on. We’re doing this for you after all. Now, without further ado, I hereby declare Monstercon 45 officially open!”\n\nA round of light applause came from the audience as Star stepped aside to let a host retake the stand to announce some of the events. Of course, she’d be staying for the entire convention to help foster a positive attitude amongst everyone, but like many things in her life, she couldn’t guarantee success because of the sheer amount of people attending, but this certainly wouldn’t stop her from trying. Who knew what surprises the world would throw at her the next five days?"

 butterfly.12.t:0 "Conclusion of Monstercon 45"
 butterfly.12.d:0 "After three days of commemoration, the closing ceremony of Monstercon 45 has taken place, with interspecies relations now on a somewhat more positive note than before. Turnout for the event was high as an estimated 26,000 Mewmans from around Forest Watchtower stopped by the convention over its tenure out of simple curiosity, interacting with the various monsters and vendors in an exchange of cultures. Songs were sung, plays were performed, food was served, and goods were served to give the mewman people a better view of who monsters are and why they deserve respect. Of course, there were hecklers and less open-minded individuals who took time to belittle and insult the monsters, but they thankfully did little to no actual damage to the convention or the monster attendees involved. In a few heartwarming scenes, some mewmans even stood up to the more closed-minded hecklers, one even in the presence of the Queen, who gave her heartfelt thanks to the supporter.\n\nAt the closing ceremony, Queen Star, alongside various tribal representatives and Monsterville President Yevgeny Bulgolyubov, once more addressed the crowd to express her gratitude for the attendee’s open-mindedness during the convention, saying that it brings mewmans and monsters one step closer to equality. Acknowledging criticism over her more cynical view of Mewman history inducing citizens to feel shame or guilt over their heritage, the Queen said that unless one had actively partaken in the oppression of the monster tribes, then they should feel no guilt or shame in their status as mewmans. “It’s important that we don’t gloss over the terrible things that have been done by us to monsterkind, because if we don’t see those actions as being wrong, then we won’t have the conscious not to repeat them. There’s nothing wrong with being proud to be a mewman or wanting to see Mewni become a better place, but that pride can’t be used to oppress or silence any creature who lives inside of it; that way, we can build a Mewni everyone can be proud of.”"

 butterfly.13.d:0 "Tragedy has struck Monstercon 45 as two days into the convention, a bomb was detonated at an outdoor performance of the monster play “Our Cousin from the Riverlands,” killing eleven bystanders, six mewmans, and five monsters. The explosion took place near the reserved area for the Monster Tribe’s representatives and the Queen, with all of the persons of interest being quickly evacuated by the Royal Guard to a secure location within the Forest Watchtower’s palace complex where thankfully none of them were hurt or killed. However, the same cannot be said for the convention attendees, as rumors quickly spread among the mewman attendees that the bomb had been planted by a Septarian infiltrator, who was planning to assassinate the entirety of the country’s leadership in a single stroke to cause chaos behind enemy lines. Though this ignores the fact that none of Star’s Mewnisters were present at the convention with the exception of Lady Juniper Forest, the rumor soon became warped to be that the Septarians had co-opted the entirety of the convention to secure an invasion, which spurred the mewmans into lynch mobs that began brutalizing the monster attendees in a reprisal.\n\nAlthough the city guard was quickly activated and deployed to the convention, they were unable, or unwilling, to stop the violence from unfolding, with those trying to protect the monsters further fueling the crowd’s anger due to their supposed treason, and some even siding with the mewmans in their vigilantism. The violence lasted throughout the remainder of the day and into the night when the remaining monsters fled the city or took shelter within designated safe zones. In total, 252 monsters were killed in the ensuing riot, with much of the Forest Watchtower also sustaining significant damage from the violence that plagued the city streets.\n\nReactions to the event have been just as brutal, with many papers condemning the Queen for allowing such a riot to break out in the first place, some even going so far as to openly endorse and celebrate the actions of the “patriotic mewmans” who took part in the rioting. The nobility has also shown little sympathy for the Queen’s plight, with many issuing statements blaming her for a continued lack of leadership and authority in the face of crisis; Lady Juniper herself even banning any future Monstercon conventions for the foreseeable future. Despite the blunt criticism, Queen Star has remained defensive of the convention’s ideals and her conduct during the riot, citing the rush to judgment on the side of mewmans and her deployment of the city guard almost immediately after the riot began, blaming the sheer tenacity of the crowds in their overwhelming of the guard. These rebuttals have mainly fallen on deaf ears, and it is clear now that mewman-monster relations have taken a turn for the worse, with many members of both species now harboring a deep distrust of the other from years of missteps, blunders, and cruelty against one another."

 butterfly.14.d:0 "“Hey Ruby, you wanted to talk with me about the Kingdom’s budget?” Star Butterfly wearily walked into Lady Ruby’s office to meet with her Mewnister of the Treasury, seating herself across from her at the room’s central desk.\n\n“Yes, it’s been of particular concern for me since the reparations were imposed. Though our Pre-War tax income is theoretically able to pay for it given a few accommodations, the devastation of the War of the Worlds appears to be hampering the economic recovery far more than what we predicted. As a result, our spending vastly exceeds our revenue, and our reserves are depleting by the day. This typically would mean that we should run a deficit and take out loans to cover our losses, but I’m not even sure we can pay that-“\n\n“Yeah, so what exactly does all this mean?” Star asked, puzzled and confused. Lady Ruby, caught off-guard by the question, recomposed herself before responding.\n\n“Well, simply, it means the Kingdom’s going bankrupt.”\n\n“Oh. Oh. Ooooh no,” Star exclaimed, dread slowly creeping into her voice.\n\n“To try to avoid this, I’d highly recommend initiating immediate austerity measures, as well as implementing new revenue-raising measures to sort out the Kingdom’s finances and possibly stave off bankruptcy. I’ve created a list of programs and institutions which we can afford to cut funding for, as well as new taxes we can impose for additional revenue,” Ruby took out a few papers from her desk before handing them over to Star, who looked over them briefly. “Ruby, these programs are really important to a lot of people. Not to mention that we’re assuming that companies won’t just pass some of these taxes off to their customers who themselves will have to spend more due to the cuts in the social safety net. Are you sure we can’t just implement the new taxes without implementing austerity?”\n\n“I’m certain. It would only slow the process down for a few months, and we need to have a sustainable budget to resolve the issue. Even with all of these measures, I’m still not sure if it’ll be enough to stave off bankruptcy given the margin of error, so I’ll try to negotiate the reparation payments down as well. Look, I know that cutting these things may be difficult, but it’s necessary for our survival. We made it through the Dark Ages without a lot of this stuff, so who’s to say we can’t do it again?”\n\nStar looked down at the list and then raised her head before responding. “Just because we made it through doesn’t mean we should do it again.”\n\n“Alright, um, well, I suppose I’ll let you think about it for a little while. I’ll see you at the next council meeting.” When Ruby finished, Star rose from her seat with the list before exiting the room."

Your conduct was completely unbecoming of a lady like you, and we’ll be lucky to smooth your infidelity over.” Ruby stood silently, barely being able to look her in the eyes, until she mustered the energy to respond “I-I-I’m sorry mother, I didn’t mean to hurt anyone.” Garnet quickly snapped back “Oh really now? Let’s think critically about this. Be really careful about what you say next.” Silence ruled over the room as Ruby simply turned her gaze downwards.\n\n“Well, just to recap, you flirted with a boy outside of your betrothal and gave the family a scandal to deal with, what did you honestly expect to happen?! That everyone just forgets or doesn’t care and goes their separate ways?! I’m honestly appalled at how oblivious you are to the harm you’re inflicting to everyone in this family. Just think about me for example. I’ve given you the best tutors and instructors I could find to ensure your academic literacy, I’ve pushed you and held you to the highest standards to ensure your competence, I’ve invested countless hours to personally give you everything you need to become a successful lady, and I have granted you every single one of your demands and concerns to give you the best life possible, and how am I rewarded?! With a punch to the gut as you throw your life away!”\n\nThe tears began to flow freely from Ruby’s face as her mother finished, feeling ashamed of herself from her mother’s scolding. Garnet merely stared at her daughter as she bawled from her eyes, contemplating her next words. “You know what? I’m done. I’m done giving you all of this, of investing my time and energy into you. You’ve clearly shown me that you’re not worth either of those two things, so I may as well rip it off right here and now.” Ruby gazed back at her mother, tears still flowing from her eyes “Mother please, I can still-“ she was cut off before she could finish. “In a few days time you’ll be nothing more than just another begged on the street, not even having the clothes on your back so that you’ll be raped by the first peasant who passes by!”\n\n“I think that’s enough Garnet,” Queen Moon entered the hallway they were standing in to the shock and bewilderment of the elder Stone. “Your majesty! I’m sorry you had to see the two of us in such an intimate state of affairs, but I-“ she was cut off again. “For now I’m only going to ask you to politely leave, alone. We’ll be discussing your punishment at the next Council Meeting, so I recommend you attend.” Despite the shock on her face Lady Garnet made a half-hearted nod before scurrying off back to her guest room in Butterfly Castle. The Queen then knelt down to meet the young lady face to face “Don’t worry about her Ruby, I’ll let you stay at the castle to avoid her, it’s going to be alright.” Ruby, still processing all that had happened, only gave a soft response to the Queen “Th-thank you, your highness.” The Queen responded in a warm and gentle voice “It was only right. Now, would you like to go back to that boy you were talking to.”\n\nAs the memory faded Ruby Stone once more found herself in her office. She was undoubtedly and eternally grateful for Queen Moon’s actions that night, but at the end of it all, Queen Moon was dead while her mother was still alive, still harboring a perfect hatred for her, both for her perceived shortcomings, and for the power she had lost that night. The Kingdoms’ recent financial challenges were just the latest outlet for such hatred, and no matter what happened she could not let that hatred be validated. Finding a new sense of motivation, she got back to work."

When Mina came to overthrow Eclipsa and bring my mom back, only for her to betray her and try to kill thousands of monsters, I took the least violent route possible by destroying magic. I’m honestly shocked at how much of a fuss everybody made over it, considering almost nobody outside of the Royal Family uses it, so you know, maybe it was just outrage for outrage’s sake since their bigoted system failed to take back control! And yes, before you bring it up again, I did mess up when I merged Earth and Mewni together, although, given the whole ‘everything is where it’s supposed to be’ thing magic has, maybe there was something to it, but what do I know about that at this point. Still, if you think that I didn’t take responsibility for those actions during the immediate aftermath and the war, then you must remember nothing about what happened.”\n\n“I was at the forefront of the failed peace negotiations, I helped create the Government of National Unity, I personally helped lead the war to defend Mewni, and when Moontown fell, and all hope seemed lost, I rallied myself and the remaining soldiers I had to retake the sanctuary and bring magic back to win! Is this what someone who would want to see their Kingdom destroyed would do?! Because I don’t think so!”\n\n“Look, all of the claims that I don’t want to be the Queen of Mewni and simply want to go back to a normal life, they’re right, I’ll never deny those. But if you think for a minute that I would just ghost all of my responsibilities and leave everything broken and in chaos, then you know nothing about me! Yeah, I don’t like it; it’s not pretty, but it’s necessary, and I will see it through. And when the day comes, when all is said and done, when Mewni is in a better place than when I found it in, I’m going to set one last thing right and bring Meteora back to the throne! Because guess what, she didn’t die during the sack on the Monster Temple, I got her out of there before it was cut off and promised Eclipsa to give her a good life, so when she becomes Queen, hopefully, that will be the point at which everyone will stop getting so testy about monsters!”\n\nStar ended her tirade, slowly panting out of her anger and general stress, yet her face gradually softened as she realized she might have gone a little too far. Across from her, Ponyhead hovered in shock at the revelations.\n\n“Uh, you ok B-fly? That was a pretty intense answer there. Actually, we should probably just cut to commercial.

 butterfly.24.d:0 "Vice Admiral Ernst Theomore sat idly in the meeting room, shaking his left leg restlessly under the table. It had been nearly thirty minutes since Mewnister of the Navy Marine Waterson had been scheduled to arrive, and many of the other attendees in the room were starting to get the feeling that she wouldn’t be showing up, but thankfully, the Mewnister arrived shortly before the half hour had passed. She appeared somewhat unkempt and was dressed in her trademark attire, albeit appearing put together, with her face displaying a feeling of reluctance and minor annoyance that wasn’t entirely out of place for the young Mewnister.\n\n“Good afternoon Lady Marine; we’re glad you showed up at the meeting today,” Admiral Phoebe Soreal took the initiative in the meeting as Marine took her seat at the head of the table.\n\n“Of course, let’s get this wrapped up all nice and quick,” Marine responded, a slight smile arising alongside it. “Ok, well, I’ll start with our proposal for ordering additional ironclads and the phasing out of the current ships of the line,” Marine’s interjection cut off Soreal. “I’m sorry, but would you mind explaining what we plan on doing with these old ships?”\n\n“Certainly, as dictated by standard protocol, we’ll be scrapping them for raw materials and selling them for profit to increase revenue,” Soreal replied, slightly unnerved by the Queen’s demeanor. “Yeah, I’m afraid I’m going to have to abrogate that plan for you; the current ships of the line are going to remain in active duty, at least in the reserves.” Marine left the room silent as she uttered those words, prompting Theomore to step up in the conversation. “So, why exactly are we keeping these ships, my lady? They’re going to be effectively useless in combat.” Marine shot back quickly, though, as if she had anticipated the question, “Well, I think that they’ll serve as excellent reconnaissance and surveying vehicles once everything is said and done. And yes, I know that the engines are more efficient and reliable at moving the ships forward, but the retrofitting process shouldn’t be too difficult or time-consuming.”\n\nThe admirals were left in a state of complete disbelief at the sheer idiocy of what was just explained by their superior. Overcoming the initial shock, Theomore continued with his inquiry, “Everything you just said is at best, misguided, no, delusional, and at worst outright suicidal. Even if we assume the engine implementation is doable, as the prevalence of Earth’s technological knowledge spreads, so will the capacity for gunnery, meaning that every recon mission we send these ships on will guarantee its destruction since we can’t give them any armor without compromising them entirely. And if we assign them purely for surveying, I would like to point out that there are far more economical ships for the job. In truth, I think your insistence on keeping them in service is solely so that you can keep hosting parties on them while writing off their costs on the naval budget, not to mention so that you can pick off our sailors to indulge your insatiable desire!”\n\nBig mistake, for as though Lady Marine’s anger rose throughout her Rear Admiral’s tirade, the comments on her infidelity pushed her over the edge.\n\n“Get out. Get out of this room right now. You’re fired for this insubordination and libel against me. And before you protest, let me make it clear that I’m only barely giving you a light sentence, and I’d advise that you take it before I change my mind.” Theomore and the rest of the room sat in shock at the development before he silently got up and walked away."

 butterfly.25.t:0 "The Revolt of the Admirals"
 butterfly.25.d:0 "It's no secret that Marine Waterson is not the best Mewnister of the Navy. She is known to be both negligent and incompetent in her duties, preferring to take part in court politics while misusing naval funds and ships for her parties, not to mention her continuous poaching of sailors and noblemen for her pleasure. This misconduct has understandably made much of the navy despise her, most notably the non-noble sailors and admiralty, who see this behavior as being detrimental to the navy's reputation and function. Though they primarily kept these complaints to themselves for the past few years, trying to work around or with Marine to try and keep a semblance of a healthy navy, the recent firing of Vice Admiral Ernst Theomore for his resistance to one of Marine's pompous actions has changed this approach. This came in the form of an open letter to the Mewnister penned by several of the most prominent and experienced admirals in the Royal Nacy, outlining their grievances and solutions to the Mewnister simply and concisely.\n\nIn it, they claim that Marine is leading the navy on a path to ruin with her hedonistic tendencies, leaving them incapable of dealing with threats such as pirates, sea monsters, and even other nations, causing public and government confidence in the institution to erode, thereby jeopardizing even more civilians to these forces due to budget cuts and reduced capabilities. This, they argue, will bring about even more problems for the country, as the primary and most convenient trade route to the rest of Mewni would be unusable, forcing merchants to take the longer, more expensive, and less efficient routes through either the Great Mewman River to the Clifford Kingdom or through the Gorge Kingdom and the Desert of Sizzling Torment, assuming they won't go bankrupt. These strains would then naturally decrease the overall trade output of the Kingdom and make it harder to import goods outside of it, thus leading to a chain reaction that would painfully reverse much of the economic growth of the past century. The letter concludes with a series of recommendations and reforms for the Royal Navy, both to improve its current operations and to prevent such abuses of power from happening again, with a final plea being made to the Queen herself, requesting of her to remove Marine Waterson as Mewnister of the Navy should she fail to correct her behavior.\n\nIn response to the letter, Marine fired all of the admirals who signed on to it for insubordination and fast-tracked several unqualified noble loyalists to their positions, citing a need for the admiralty to be subservient to their lords and ladies. Though this has dealt with the issue of the "disloyal" admirals, for the time being, the letter was published publicly in the navy's official newspaper and has sparked widespread outrage amongst servicemembers turning the Mewnister into even more of a point of mockery and hate among sailors, with the dismissal of several popular and well-respected admirals being only their latest grievance against her."

 butterfly.26.t:0 "Naval Mutiny at Waterson Port!"
 butterfly.26.d:0 "The recent mass firings in the navy have made an already delicate situation even worse. Though Marine Waterson was already a widely despised Mewnister, her recent purge of the admiralty has only poured more fuel on the fire, with more and more sailors committing open acts of defiance against her to protest her tenure as Mewnister. Although this in of itself would ordinarily be considered problematic, things took a sharp turn for the worse today when a collective of low and mid-level officers issued a list of demands to the Waterson family and the central government and began the rapid mobilization of sailors into ad hoc militias to seize control of the city. The demands in question would see the creation of separate civilian and military leadership for the navy, rather than a single noble commander, as well as the creation of an inspector general to ensure the proper use of naval assets. However, the most radical of these demands would unquestionably be the complete barring of any noble family from holding the new positions established by these demands.\n\nEquipped mostly with swords, spears, as well as a small number of rifles, the sailors quickly gained control over the port from the loyalists, many of whom promptly defected or declared their allegiance to the mutineers. Upon reaching the city streets, the rebels came into contact with the still loyal city guard and the personal retinue of Marine Waterson, with considerably fierce fighting ensuing, both sides struggled to gain control over the strategic areas, but after aproximently twelve hours of fighting, it became clear that the mutineers had the upper hand, forcing the loyalists to withdraw outside the city walls, placing it under siege to contain the revolt. Worse still, following the battle’s conclusion, many local citizens began demonstrating in favor of the mutiny, with many even volunteering to bolster their ranks, stoking fears that this mutiny is morphing into a general popular uprising in the region. Thankfully, all communication lines out of the city were cut shortly before the withdrawal, limiting the revolt’s ability to spread its propaganda and message to the broader public, who remain under the impression that this is merely a naval mutiny independent of the people’s will.\n\nIn some good news, Marine Waterson, her family, and the other noble families in the city escaped the city, and pockets of loyalists remain active within some of the major government buildings, such as the actual palace complex. Still, they can only hold out for so long before they fall to the rebel onslaught and have no chance of retaking the city on their own."

This action kicked off this whole chain of events that have tragically gotten out of hand, and as such, I feel responsible for its outbreak but am also compelled to try to help end it. When news of the mutiny first broke out, and the mutineers seized control of the city, I contacted one of my junior officers to get an assessment of the situation on the ground, only to discover that he had been one of the primary organizers of the mutiny. Using this connection, I requested to negotiate a settlement between the mutineers and the government, and though initially expressing skepticism of my chances of success, gave me the approval of the cabal of officers at the head of the uprising to make my attempt, leading me to now. If you accept my offer at negotiations, I will be available to meet with you in two days. I will conclude with an appeal to you directly that the avoidance of further bloodshed in this conflict should be the desired outcome for all parties, something that I still hope you can find sentiment in.\nSincerely- Ernst Caspain Theomore”\n\n“Your majesty, with all due respect, don’t you think that letting the person who caused this whole disaster to fix it is a bad idea?” Marine said after a brief period of silence. “Well, don’t you think that’s a little hypocritical, Marine?” The Queen’s response caused Marine to blush lightly before falling back into her seat, leaving the two other Mewnisters without her.\n\n“Even if Theodore’s intentions with these negotiations are noble ones, we need to remember that by giving in to his demands, we would be giving the impression to the wider public that treason works. We would be saying that if you forcefully resist the government, you would be able to have your way with them no matter how ridiculous or insane your demands are! It would be nothing less than a show of weakness and of our inability to police our citizens!” Falcon Redbird piped up to give his impressions before being followed by Percy McKnight, “It’s also worth noting that our popularity isn’t exactly in the best of places, and this possible negotiation could give others the initiative they’ve been waiting for.”\n\nAnother silence swept over the room as the Queen was plunged deep in thought; the decision was her’s to make in the end."

 butterfly.28.d:0 "With the deployment of reinforcements from the surrounding areas, the military forces outside Waterson Port were placed under the direct command of Mewnister Percy McKnight, with Beatrice Walton, notable primarily for her tactical competence and general brutality, as his adjutant general. Against the wishes of other officers to breach the city walls and link up with the loyalist forces, McKnight instead chose to continue besieging the city in an attempt to starve them into submission, thus minimizing casualties on his end. This strategy went on for eight days before a night scout spotted an unmarked vessel docking in the city. Apparently, the mutineers had been circumventing the entire siege effort from the beginning by masking their ships as mercantile vessels and buying supplies from nearby ports, most of which also belonged to us.\n\nWith this tactical blunder, McKnight conceded more power to his subordinates, with General Walton quickly becoming the de facto leader of forces there, who promptly ordered an artillery barrage against the city walls followed up with an infantry assault to retake the city against the inferiorly equipped mutineers. This went as planned, and the soldiers quickly assaulted the city through multiple entry points, which was when problems began to develop, as Walton had issued orders to use “as much force as possible” against any enemy combatants, with no explicit directions for handling those trying to surrender. Street by street, the army slaughtered the defenders, both mutineers, and volunteers, in broad daylight, with even civilians being caught in the crossfire for speaking out against the killings or simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Even the remaining loyalist forces were not immune, as when they were relieved and tried to protect their besiegers, they were accused of being rebels themselves and were shot on sight, and though this didn’t escalate into full-scale fighting, it did undoubtedly dampen their rescue.\n\nThe bloodbath lasted approximately five hours and saw an estimated 5,500 people killed. As for the mutiny leadership, they were able to successfully negotiate the peaceful surrender of the remaining troops once they saw how bad the situation was getting for them, with the remnants of their forces being processed into prisons across the country. Regardless of the incident, Marine Waterson personally thanked Walton for her swift and decisive action in crushing the revolt, while Falcon Redbird congratulated her in bringing the rebels “No less than what they deserve.” Meanwhile, the remaining Mewnisters have remained mostly silent, though some, including Percy McKnight and even Queen Star herself, are privately furious, wishing to see Walton prosecuted for her actions, though the actual possibility of this remains extremely unlikely."

 butterfly.29.d:0 "Arriving at Butterfly Castle earlier today, former Vice Admiral Ernst Theomore sat with Queen Star to negotiate a possible resolution to the ongoing mutiny at Waterson Port. Fearing possible retaliation and pushback from her Mewnisters, the Queen sat alone with Theomore as they discussed possible resolutions, with Theomore revealing that he had already secured a series of more lenient demands from the mutineers before the meeting and began to recite them to the Queen.\n\nOf these demands, the request that new civilian and military commands be created for the management of the Navy reduced to only creating a single, all-encompassing military command known as the Admiralty Council, under the leadership of the newly created position of the First Lord of the Admiralty, that would have all of the powers that would have been allocated between the two positions. The role of the Mewnister of the Navy would be reduced to being a largely ceremonial one, and the nobility would still be banned from holding any position within the Admiralty Council. Furthermore, the office of an Inspector General for the Navy would also be established to oversee the proper implementation and use of naval funds and assets. Finally, in a tradeoff for maintaining Marine Waterson as Mewnister of the Navy, albeit only in a ceremonial capacity, the mutineers have requested that all admirals that were fired or dismissed by her recently be reinstated.\n\nThough the Queen entirely agrees with the terms of the agreement and would typically implement them within a moment's notice, she does have some underlying fears regarding the reactions from some of her Mewnisters and how they could potentially pose a political danger to her in the future. Still, she is the Queen, after all, and the Mewnisters have little actual ability to oppose her in policymaking."

 butterfly.30.d:0 "When Queen Star Butterfly, alongside Vice Admiral Ernst Theomore, stepped past the loyalist front lines and walked to one of the main gates leading into Waterson Port, the collective rebels were unsure of what to do. Do they shoot the Queen on sight, or do they let her talk to them? Why was Theomore with her? Was he a hostage to preserve the Queen’s safety, or had he willingly sold their cause out? The questions only grew up until the point where the two arrived at the gate, upon which one of the nearest rebel commanders, an Ensign, approached the two to ascertain their motives. Theomore responded by saying he and the Queen had been granted permission from the rebel leaders to address the sailors outside the palace complex on the government’s behalf. Following a quick call with said leaders to ascertain the truthfulness of the claims, they opened the gates to let the two inside.\n\nCuriosity and intrigue still dominated the city streets as the two made their way to the palace. The Queen appeared nervous and unsure instead of her usual upbeat and impulsive attitude, which juxtaposed with Theomore’s calmer gentlemanly, and minorly charismatic approach. Many reserve volunteers, sailors, and ordinary passersby gazed at the two in an attempt to try and understand their presence, most if not all of them hoping for the best from such an encounter. Finally, they arrived at the palace complex, where the retinue quickly ushered them in, before being briefed on the two’s plans, whereupon a public address was organized on a balcony facing one of the public gardens found throughout the city.\n\nAfter servants placed the audio equipment to ensure that the people could hear the speakers from beyond the palace walls, Theomore met the crowd of rebels and civilians to cautious applause. Beginning his speech, he thanked the Queen for her willingness to work beyond the traditional bounds of the nobility and announced that she had agreed to restore all purged admirals to their positions following their criticism. Furthermore, he then relayed the creation of the position of the Inspector General of the Royal Navy before finally proclaiming that the role of Mewnister of the Navy would be rendered mute, due to the creation of new military leadership, with the First Lord of the Admiralty, and the Admiralty Council.\n\nThis announcement saw voracious applause from the mutineers among the crowd as they celebrated the downfall of Mewnister Waterson. However, many civilians among them, both rebel and bystander, took a somewhat more reserved approach. Regardless, Theomore continued, eventually handing the stage to the Queen for her comments. Timidly taking the stage, Star expressed her satisfaction at the revolt’s peaceful conclusion and thanked the mutineers for reciprocating the deal and her and Vice Admirals Theomore’s presence. Suddenly pivoting her speech, Star then unveiled that her edicts would become effective immediately, with work being done with reinstated admirals to ensure a neat and orderly transition to the new power structure. Furthermore, she then stated that she had already decided upon a new appointment for the First Lord of the Admiralty, Ernst Theomore. Once more, the crowd erupted into a frenzy at the announcement, with even Theomore looking stunned and taken aback at the revelation. Star saw her confidence growing again as she saw the cheering below, and she gestured for Theomore to stand beside her, where they joined hands and raised them triumphantly."

 butterfly.31.d:0 "Although all of the mutinous sailors quickly returned to their ships at the behest of their commanding officers and normalcy generally returned to Waterson Port shortly after Queen Star’s, and Ernst Theomore’s speech, not all were pleased with such an outcome. Though the Navy, both in the rebel contingent and the small loyalist one, has been incredibly receptive and even jubilant at the settlement issued, other parties within the government have been far more critical. The most prominent and evident of these critics would undoubtedly be the nobility, who have all issued public statements on the matter, which have ranged in tone from cautiously optimistic to outright denunciation.\n\nOf note are Falcon Redbird, Jasmine Flowers, and Marine Waterson, who make up the most negative responses from the nobles. Falcon Redbird and Jasmine Flowers denounced the agreement as a sign of weakness for the state, as they have effectively given in to the mutineers’ demands and have now paved the way for like-minded individuals to extort the Kingdoms on its terms. Furthermore, they’ve also criticized Star’s disregard of the council and noble interest, although they stopped short of outright accusing her of tyranny. Additionally, Lady Flowers has noted that Star’s decision to grant amnesty to all of the participants of the mutiny may set an unwelcome precedent for future rebellions and uprisings, which may encourage future dissidents due to a lack of legal consequences. Lady Marine’s response, however, is more comical than anything else, with her going on an unhinged tirade against the Queen more akin to a temper tantrum than a proper response, leveling unsupported accusations against her and the mutineers while unknowingly contradicting herself on multiple occasions. Unsurprisingly, House Waterson retracted it a day later and was replaced by a generic statement expressing gratitude for the Queen’s intervention and the peaceful resolution of the conflict.\n\nMore concerning, however, would be the public reception from Waterson Port itself, which has been overwhelmingly negative, as many citizens feel left out or ignored by the agreement in its entirety. Their support came from a mutual hatred of Marine Waterson not for her misconduct as Mewnister of the Navy but through the governance of her realm. With the deal being entirely targeted at the Royal Navy, they feel it was made purely to take the backbone out of their uprising, upholding the status quo in the process. Although they returned to their homes and families as the sailors returned to their ships, the underlying resentment towards the government remains at a record high, and rumors are circulating that a second uprising is imminent, though these claims are unfounded."

 butterfly.32.d:0 "Beneath the citadel of Redbird Nest lay the headquarters of the United Kingdoms’ intelligence service, the Red Capes, though many would be more inclined to call it Lord Falcon’s hit team. Gathered within one of the facility’s primary meeting rooms sat many of the organization’s senior officials, who Lord Falcon himself soon joined as he entered the room, signifying the meeting’s formal beginning.\n\n“Good afternoon, everyone; I would like to thank you all for attending this extraordinary convocation, as it tends to be a matter of the utmost importance to our Kingdom’s integrity. Although all of you are aware of the increased activity of the United Republican Front since the War’s conclusion, certain circumstances within our finances now threaten to strengthen them even more. In simple terms, we’re going bankrupt. There’s no need to panic amongst you all; the remaining funds for justice, palace servants, and national security will be a top priority, and we will ensure that you are adequately paid. However, such guarantees cannot be made for our domestic stability, and we need to brace ourselves for the inevitable chaos that the public will incur following our default. The peasantry is not content with pinning the blame on her; rather, they will seek out the URF, or the URF will take advantage of them to completely dismantle our entire government and replace it with nothing short of mob rule. Though many of us, myself included, do still harbor a great resentment towards the Queen, it should be remembered that a failure to protect her is a failure to protect yourselves. With this in mind, we will be beginning new initiatives to cripple the URF before the oncoming wave of disturbance reaches us, and the best way to do that is through the apprehension of its leadership, of which Mr. Yarborough should provide the details and guidance for.” Gesturing to the man closest to his left, Micheal Yarborough took his turn to begin his presentation, starting the projector overhead to display the files of the various persons of interest.\n\n“Thank you for the time, Lord Falcon. The URF is led by a committee of five known as the Directorate, although only three members have been identified. Robert Lawerence, Herschel Newman, and Julia Cast. Lawrence is a former prosecutor for the Crown and was the Special Prosecutor in the Richardson-Petunia Affair Probe; he is also widely seen as being the political head of the URF, responsible for maintaining the group’s unity and engaging in negotiations with other anti-government groups to deter conflicts amongst one another. Newman was the Marshal of the Butterfly Kingdom from 823 to 835 and is probably the most high-profile of the Directorate members; he’s tasked with organizing the group’s recruitment drives, military activities, and general acquisition of intelligence. Finally, we have Julia Cast, who doubles as both a member of the Directorate and as the Editor-in-Chief of the underground paper The Commoner’s Post. This naturally makes her the media head of the URF, with her managing propaganda for the group to bolster its image amongst the public, and is quite effective at it if our estimate that 35% of the population read it regularly. Though all three should be considered as high priority targets, our current resources mean that we are only capable of hunting out one of them at this time, such a decision I have left to you, Lord Redbird.”"

 butterfly.33.t:0 "Operation Waterfall"
 butterfly.33.d:0 "Given his role as the de facto leader of the URF, it was obvious that Robert Lawrence should be the primary target for the Red Capes. Codenamed Operation Waterfall, the mission’s first objective was to pinpoint Lawrence’s location, which would prove quite challenging given the URF’s measures to conceal his location. Though preliminary intelligence has suggested that Lawrence is most likely hiding in a URF safe house within the Butterfly Castle Castletown, actually finding leads as to which building is housing him, let alone knowing what buildings are truly safe houses, has proven to be somewhat challenging and led to an investigative impasse for several days.\n\nHowever, a breakthrough came when an unconnected raid on a URF hideout in Cottonville led to the capture of a secretary for a high-ranking commander within the URF’s ranks, giving us a valuable (albeit somewhat limited) informant in our hunt for Lawrence. Through interrogation, we have been able to gather that Lawrence relocates from one location to another quite frequently to throw off any attempts at hunting him down, with the safe houses he resides in typically being more well fortified and sophisticated than the average URF base. Though this usually wouldn’t be of much use to us, we were lucky enough that the secretary also happened to have accompanied her superior to a personal meeting with Lawrence four days before her capture, with it being “possible” that he is still at the safe house she last saw him in. However, we’ll have to move quickly, as it is also highly likely that he is aware of our new informant and is making preparations to vacate the facility to somewhere more secure. Thankfully, this process would generally require a week of preparations, giving us some hope that we’ll still be able to catch him off guard."

 butterfly.34.t:0 "Operation Blue Star"
 butterfly.34.d:0 "With his military expertise in leading strikes against the government, it was clear that Hershel Newman should be the primary target for the Red Capes. Codenamed Operation Blue Star, the efforts to locate Newman began attempting to trace his location using laundered shipments of goods and products Newman was known to either enjoy or need. This information was gained from the professional relationship between Newman and Lord Falcon between 832 and 835 when their tenures as Marshal and Mewnister of the Interior overlapped and appears to have brought some results, as Newman’s probable location has been identified within Butterfly Castle’s Castletown. Based on Newman’s disdain for corn and preference for Florentine bread, agents were able to identify and track shipments of bread from the port cities of Waterson Port, Roman Port, and Gardenfowl to the capitol, where it was believed Newman resided, further narrowing down potential sites based on the legitimacy of their destinations. While this provided some leads, a true breakthrough in the investigation came when further scrutiny of the other shipments to the candidate sites revealed a package of artificial tears, a treatment for dry eyes that Newman is known to have.\n\nThis narrowed the search down to an inn known as ‘The Breezy Inn’ on the city’s southeastern outskirts beyond the city walls, and though trips to the location by agents do appear to suggest that the business is legitimate in some capacity, we also have reason to suspect that it also operates as a funding operation and safe house for the URF. Regardless, we’ve already planned a raid on the facility to end its operations and potentially gain a valuable asset in our suppression of these terrorists."

 butterfly.35.t:0 "Operation Harlequinn"
 butterfly.35.d:0 "With her ability to mobilize the public and spread the URF’s message, it was clear that Julia Cast should be the primary target for the Red Capes. Codenamed Operation Harlequin, the first part of the mission was determining how to get their hands on Cast in the first place. As the Editor-in-Chief of the Commoner’s Post, we determined that finding a way to infiltrate the paper and capture her from the inside would be the ideal means of detaining her, but problems arose regarding the newspaper’s internal structure. There are two primary components to the organization of the Commoner’s Post, the newsroom in which most of their investigations and reporting take place and a decentralizing distribution network that circulates the paper to the masses. We have been only able to infiltrate the latter, and the newsroom has been ruled out as infeasible for the time being given the extreme prerequisites one needs to be accepted, not to mention the fact we do not know what the hiring process entails.\n\nAs such, we will have to be forced to conduct the operation entirely through the distribution network, which in and of itself only has contact with the newsroom through the final drafts of newspaper volumes they send them, making it difficult to gain a connection straight to Cast. However, we may have discovered a breakthrough with our operation, as one of our agents within a distribution center has positively found a member of the Editorial Board working on a semi-regular basis within the center in question. The member, Beatrice Worth, is working at the center voluntarily and is doing it to simply help spread the republican message while also helping to improve morale within the distribution centers by providing a personal connection between themselves and the newsroom, something which has been a common criticism among distributors.\n\nWith this information in hand, we were able to track down Worth to her home and presented her with an ultimatum. Either she is arrested as a traitor right then and there to face execution, or she cooperates with the Red Capes in a sting operation to capture Julia Cast in exchange for amnesty. Wisely, she chose the latter, and we are now laying the trap to apprehend the ever-elusive Cast."

 butterfly.36.t:0 "Operation Waterfall- Failure"
 butterfly.36.d:0 "Making little haste in their rush to apprehend the ever-elusive figurehead of the URF, a task force was quickly assembled to raid the suspected hideout of Robert Lawrence, a bakery that served as a URF front business known as Dolph’s Doughery in the western end of Castletown. Upon their arrival, the operatives quickly cordoned off the street the company was based on, though the commanding officer on site decided against immediately storming the building, fearing the URF’s entrenched and well-fortified position within it would inflict substantial casualties on the agents. Instead, they opted first to lay siege to the building to attempt to coerce the defendants into peacefully surrendering, erecting numerous encampments and barricades further surrounding the complex. After making themselves known to the occupants, a brief skirmish erupted with militiamen on the building’s second-floor firing down on the agents below, though thankfully, only two were wounded before they abruptly withdrew from the windows.\n\nDespite this initial setback, negotiators made some progress in a surrender agreement, as the URF agreed to peacefully release civilian customers caught up in the siege amidst their dining and shopping. However, progress soon ground to a halt when the URF representatives stopped responding to our negotiators ten minutes after the release of the civilians. Unphased by this setback, the leadership elected to continue the siege for roughly another hour before a muffled explosion was heard beneath the building. Fearing whatever the soldiers inside were doing, the order to storm the building was immediately issued, with agents bursting down the bakery’s doors and bracing for any remaining troops inside, only to find it completely abandoned.\n\nFurther searching of the building did indeed uncover some armories and other caches of support equipment, but no documents, records, or personnel could be found, seemingly vanishing without a trace from the premises. After a brief period of confusion, an answer to this mystery was uncovered in the form of a caved-in tunnel entrance in the basement floor, the apparent source of the explosion heard earlier, and the destination of the remaining occupants. No URF members could be identified despite an ad hoc search being initiated in the immediate area surrounding the bakery, though witness reports did notice a moderate amount of people emerging from a building directly behind Dolph’s Doughery, with these individuals most likely being plainclothes URF members. A search of the building they reportedly emerged from was also completely abandoned, barring some leftover armories and support equipment."
